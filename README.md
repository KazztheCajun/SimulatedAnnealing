### Simulated Annealing Agorithms

SerialSA.c -- An implimentation of my simulated annealing algorithm designed to execute total iterations in serial (loop 1 then loop 2 then loop 3)

ParallelSA.c -- Initial Open MP implimentation of my SA algorithm, designed to execute the total iterations in parallel in a Shared Memory environment.

BenchmarkPSA_OMP.c -- Modified implimentation of ParallelSA, designed to accept input values for the hyperparameters in order to tune them for future experiments.

MPI_PSA.c -- Initial MPI implimentation of my SA algorithm, designed to execute the total iterations in parallel in a Distrubuted Memory environment
